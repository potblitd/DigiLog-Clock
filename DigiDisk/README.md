### Idea
The main goal is to first design an interface with the fewest single-shaft rotating axes to properly display all 7-segment digits and then, to elaborate the most effective rotations sequence to create a counter. Before getting into the design part of the display, a few considerations need to be set based on the future electronic implementation part of this project.
+ Use cheap and easily available components
+ Simple setup with as little parts as possible
+ Modular to add more 2-digit assemblies

## Implementation
### Components
For the electronic part, which basically controls the movements of the rotating elements, almost only breakout modules are used in order to keep the assembly and programming simple. The main components for one display are listed below.

+ ATtiny402 microcontroller
+ PCF8563 real-time clock
+ PCA9685 PWM driver
+ 4 x SG90 servo motor
